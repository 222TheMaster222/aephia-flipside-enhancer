# Aephia Flipside Enhancer

**Aephia Flipside Enhancer** is a tool that makes your Aephia dashboards on Flipside easier to read. It replaces long, confusing public keys with friendly, descriptive names so you can quickly understand what you're looking at.

## What It Does

- **Easier-to-Read Dashboard:**  
  Instead of showing long, random strings (public keys) for player profiles and fleets, the tool displays clear, descriptive names.

- **Automatic Updates:**  
  The script automatically fetches the latest friendly names from an online lookup list. This means you always see the most up-to-date information—without any extra effort.

- **Works in the Background:**  
  Once installed, it runs quietly in your web browser when you visit an Aephia dashboard, so you don’t need to do anything extra.

### Step 3: Enjoy an Enhanced Dashboard

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to do anything else?**  
A: No! After installation, the tool works in the background. Simply refresh or visit an Aephia dashboard to see the enhancements.

**Q: What if I still see a public key instead of a name?**  
A: Sometimes there might not be a matching friendly name in the lookup list yet. We’re continuously updating the list, so check back later for improvements.

**Q: How do I force an update?**  
A: You can manually update the script from the Tampermonkey dashboard if needed, or it will auto-update as new versions are released.
